#Parametrized quicksort

Generic Quicksort. (Rust,Typescript,Prolog,Ocaml)

Write 3 different versions of quicksort (in each language), which explicitly:

Sort a list of integers in ascending order

Sorts a list of ``anything'' via an externally provided comparison function.

Sorts a list of ``anything'' via an externally provided comparison function, and an externally provided partition function (which itself uses the comparison function).
